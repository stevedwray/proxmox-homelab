# benchmark-panel (planning workspace)

One Dash control panel for every benchmark: CyberSecEval and the eval
battery (GPQA, IFEval, BFCL, AgentBench, RepoBench). Every run records
which model answered, its scores, duration, tokens and tokens/s, and
both kinds of run share one queue for Framework.

Status: **planning, waiting on operator decisions (2026-10-08).** See
[plan.md](plan.md): "Where things stand", the proposed design, and the
five decisions under "Decisions needed".
