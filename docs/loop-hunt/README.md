# loop-hunt (workspace)

Follow-up to [docs/ctx-bug-test](../ctx-bug-test/README.md). That test
found no looping and no fork-vs-upstream difference for Qwen3.8-Flash-Next
under clean conditions (fresh context per request, one slot, no cache), so
the looping seen in real use (GLM-5.3-Flash and Qwen3.8-Flash-Next) was not
reproduced. This plan tests the real-use conditions it left out: long
multi-turn sessions, prompt-cache reuse, 4 parallel slots, context
overflow, 262k context, the fork's older build, real Open WebUI chats, and
a blind judge for semantic looping and context echoing. See
[plan.md](plan.md).

Status: **lh-01 complete; lh-01b stopped at deep-research scan failure**
(2026-10-15). Decisions D-L1 to D-L7 are settled. The corrected plan leaves
parallel unset and requires the pilot to confirm the expected shared-pool
slot layout through `/props` and `/slots`; a different layout stops the pilot.

The [scan tools](../../scripts/loop-hunt/README.md) pass all 29 tests,
including a read-only online backup of committed WAL-only rows and a snapshot
integrity check. Under explicit `loop-hunt-chat-scan` approval the tools were
copied to Framework and the live database was opened read-only for backup.
The snapshot passed integrity_check; scanning it found **12 chats, 14
assistant messages and zero hits**. No history parent links were broken.
All 14 assistant messages are from **2026-07** and estimate **<32k tokens**.

| Stored model id | Assistant messages | Flagged messages |

There are no saved Qwen Q4/Q2 or GLM assistant messages in this database.
This scan therefore provides neither examples nor client sampling settings
for the target models; it does not disprove the reported real-use loops.
No hit excerpts exist. Only aggregate counts from the scan are recorded here.

Framework artifacts remain at
`/storage/artifacts/loop-hunt/chat-scan-20261014/` (Framework's date):
`summary.md` and an empty `hits.jsonl`, both private. The full snapshot and
all snapshot sidecars were deleted, and deletion plus output permissions
were verified read-only. No live DB writes, model loads/inference or service
changes occurred; no chats or stored request parameters were copied locally.

The operator confirmed server-default sampling (no sampling fields in
requests) and Q2 exclusion. Replay remains pending: loops were observed in
**VS Code Copilot agent mode and benchmark harnesses**, so lh-01b scans
benchmark/deep-research transcripts before the later local Copilot scan.

lh-01b's lm_eval, CyberSecEval and deep-research adapters are built and tested.
They keep recorded model/build/settings provenance, avoid duplicate extracted
or judge responses, and count evidence-backed cap exhaustion separately
from looping candidates. Missing identity/cap evidence is reported explicitly.
Only source-host hit files contain bounded excerpts and whitelisted settings;
no full prompts/transcripts or API keys are exported. The code's CSE path
is `/srv/cyberseceval/runs/<run>/responses.json`.

The operator approved `loop-hunt-transcript-scan` on 2026-10-15. Read-only
discovery confirmed 43 eval sample files, 34 deep-research session files and
78 CSE response files on the expected two LXCs. Only the approved private
scan directories and tool copies were created.

Eval scanning completed: **5,571 responses, 75 flagged responses, zero
evidence-backed cap-exhausted flags** across 43 files. The flags are
mechanical candidates, not confirmed loops. Reports remain on ai-services-stack
under `/srv/eval-runner/loop-hunt-scan-20261015/eval/`.
The deep-research scan then failed with the scanner's generic input error
before publishing a report. The command stopped before printing summaries,
so no model/month/flag breakdown or excerpts have been returned. CSE scanning,
lh-01c and lh-02 have not run. No production commands followed the failure.

The plan's failed-gate rule requires stopping here. Proposed next action is
an approved read-only schema diagnostic of the deep-research files, exposing
only a failing file pointer, exception class and key/type structure; then a
local tested fix and the remaining scans. Preserve completed eval outputs.
No raw transcripts, prompts, settings or excerpts have been copied locally;
only aggregate counts and execution status are recorded in git.

To run it, open the `~/git/proxmox-homelab-ctx-bug-test` worktree in VS
Code, `git pull --ff-only`, and tell Codex:
